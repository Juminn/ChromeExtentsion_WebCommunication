## 0. overview

This extension allows you to view comments on YouTube videos in real time. In other words, if user A writes a comment at 1 minute and 32 seconds of a video, when user B later views the video, user A's comment appears at 1 minute and 32 seconds. In other words, while watching a video by yourself, which is not a live broadcast, you can feel the sense of presence as if you were watching a video while watching other users' comments while laughing and chatting with friends.

## 1. environment:

- JAVA Script, html, css(Chrome Extension)
- Node.js(server)
- MySQL(DB)
